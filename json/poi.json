In this dense concrete jungle, your attention is constantly being divided among a thousand different things. Neon, fluorescent signs flash advertisements for all manner of amenities and businesses. The streets rumble with the sound of engines and metal scraping from the subway system deep underground. Hordes of men and women from every imaginable background walk these cruel streets, trying desperately to eke out a pitiful existence for themselves. This district never unwinds from its constant 24/7 slime-induced mania for even a moment, let alone sleep.\nDowntown is the beating heart of New Los Angeles City, aka Neo Milwaukee. With settlements in the area predating the emergence of slime, its prime location along the newly formed coastline naturally grew it into the cultural, economic, and literal center of the city. Due to its symbolic and strategic importance, it's home to the most intense gang violence of the city. Gunshots and screams followed by police sirens are background noises for this district. Some say that this propensity for violence is result of the sinister influence from an old obelisk in the center of town, ominously called ENDLESS WAR. You aren\u2019t sure if you believe that, though.\n\nThis area contains ENDLESS WAR, SlimeCorp HQ, the Slime Stock Exchange and the Downtown Subway Station. To the north is Smogsburg. To the East is the Green Light District. To the South is the Rowdy Roughhouse. To the Southwest is Poudrin Alley. To the West is Krak Bay. To the Northwest is Cop Killtown.",

You\u2019ll have to keep your wits about you if you want to leave here with your wallet, Crookline is perhaps most known for its hordes of petty thieves who specialise in stealing from clueless juveniles from the posher districts. Despite these hurdles, or possibly because of them, Crookline has a bustling nightlife heavily featuring those aforementioned speakeasies. No matter where you are in this district, you\u2019re not more than a block or two from a jazz club. You sort of feel like you\u2019re on the set of a film noir movie when you traverse these dark alleyways.\nCrookline was a historically rebellious settlement on the edge of New Los Angeles City aka Neo Milwaukee, resisting full annexation for years until it was fully culturally and economically dominated by the city. Because of this, the residents have always kept an independent streak, and remain vehemently opposed most aspects of slime past its purely utilitarian purposes. You get the feeling the denizens of this district would have been happier if there was gold discovered in the area rather than the green, morality obliterating substance they\u2019re stuck with.\n\n To the North is Jaywalker Plain.

Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately for the thrill seekers among us, the mountains here are far too steep for anyone to actually skii down without a death wish to attempt them. Seriously, there are just a series of ninety degree drops in some places, and that\u2019s not even to mention the yetis, don\u2019t even get me started on the yetis. Of course, none of this stops the locals, who eagerly careen off the side of cliffs and then take the lift back up for seconds after they revive. If you want to down some cheap instant hot coco before flying off the summit of a fucking mountain, then this district is for you. Maimridge used to be considered part of the outskirts, but recently it has grown enough of a stable population to be considered a real district. Its claim to fame is, of course, the impressive mountains in its borders. To the south is Astatine Heights.

Of course you haven\u2019t, no one has. They\u2019re just money laundering fronts and sometimes meeting spots for members to plan out their campaigns against whoever\u2019s been tardy with their tribute and who to extort from next. Of course, they provide a level of vigilante justice to the neighborhood too, punishing random acts of lawlessness in favor of their totally reasonable brand of lawlessness. These gangsters are a part of a long, complex history in South Sleezeborough between local weeaboos, immigrant westaboos, and their struggle for supremacy. This thorny issue has even threatened the integrity of the Triad itself, as some members wish to cling unto their traditional way of life and show solidarity with the asianophile weeaboos, while others have grown accustomed to their new cultures and support the westaboos.

Here in South Sleezeborough's Little Tokyo, which is just an outdoor shopping center with six parking spaces and even fewer stores located on the corner of a busy intersection, is a branch of the infamous Yazuka. These chivalrous knights of bushido hail from glorious Nippon, and seek to literally prevent culture death. Like, that's genuinely their whole deal. No joke. They're fucking ripped, wear suits and ties that are totally on fleek, are inked head-to-toe in intracate and geneally fucking crazy tattoos, and can kick your ass using psychic powers. I don't even really know what crimes they commit, all I see them do is get drunk in the ramen bars in their shopping center, beat the shit out of each other and passerbys, and go on romantic adventures to kill westerners and other degenerate races. What\u2019s not to like? This gang is not to be confused with the Yellow Yakuza, which has way more members. This street connects back into South Sleezeborough.

See, crushing poudrins ain\u2019t a science, it\u2019s an art. When just crushing it with your bare hands, inevitably some of the poudrin doesn\u2019t get converted into slime and is therefore wasted. Some clever miners found out that you could combine cyanide with a water mixture and when you submerged a poudrin into it, you\u2019d be able to strain it all and wind up with a particularly well concentrated distillation of pure slime-- perfect for crushing. Well, this was so popular that the leftover sludge mixture began to pile up and up until its containment unit broke and flooded all the shafts in the region with its goopy innards. All of the bogs you see around you were once profitable mineshafts. This street connects back into Toxington. This street is connected to Curie Highschool, Gravel Mounds, and Quarantined Zones.",

That isn\u2019t to say a little fear of death stopped anyone from mining slime, but the sheer concentration of radiation here made it hard to even get to the slime veins in the first place before croaking. Plus, with the gravel mounds just a hop, skip, and a jump away, who needs to waste time making razor thin profit margins here when they can throw their lives away in shafts where they\u2019ll actually make some real slime.

The windows are completely packed by dusty non-perishables, and the interior is not much better with every  inch of space selling snacks or household basics in a visually deafening assault of brand names. However, those in the know simply stroll past all this noise and head for the old Snapple machine in the back of the shop. The machine is not that at all but a door that slides open to reveal a whole other store on the other side, this is the real Bodega. Neatly appointed, lacquered shelves hold the latest in street and skate fashion from shoes to shirts to jackets. The whole space is clean and orderly in a far cry from the cramped store front.\n\n(This description was literally just stolen and lightly edited from Atlas Obsurca. This is a real place in Boston, look it up. Pretty sick, huh?)\n\nThe well-trimmed, over-cologned four-eyed hipster behind the counter looks upon you with what can only be described as the freakish offspring of utter disdain and mindlessly sycophantic puppy-dog eyes that hope to lure you into an ill-advised purchase of high end socks that forces you to take out a second mortgage on your house. *SHARP INHALE*. He\u2019ll !sew the dirty, unwashed rags you dare call clothing back together if it gets shredded in combat, for a price.
