Hordes of men and women from every imaginable background walk these cruel streets, trying desperately to eke out a pitiful existence for themselves. This district never unwinds from its constant 24/7 slime-induced mania for even a moment, let alone sleep.\nDowntown is the beating heart of New Los Angeles City, aka Neo Milwaukee. With settlements in the area predating the emergence of slime, its prime location along the newly formed coastline naturally grew it into the cultural, economic, and literal center of the city. Due to its symbolic and strategic importance, it's home to the most intense gang violence of the city. Gunshots and screams followed by police sirens are background noises for this district. Some say that this propensity for violence is result of the sinister influence from an old obelisk in the center of town, ominously called ENDLESS WAR. You aren't sure if you believe that, though.\n\nThis area contains ENDLESS WAR, SlimeCorp HQ, the Slime Stock Exchange and the Downtown Subway Station. To the north is Smogsburg.
