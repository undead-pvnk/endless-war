You may supply as much or as little slime as you like, but greater Slime contribution will lead to superior Slimeoid genesis. To begin the Slimeoid creation process, use **!incubateslimeoid** followed by the amount of slime you wish to use."

If you want to give your Slimeoid some identifying information, get a dog tag and **!tagslimeoid**. Alternatively, **!untagslimeoid** to re-obscure its identity.
