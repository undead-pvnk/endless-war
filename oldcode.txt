See, crushing poudrins ain't a science, it's an art. When just crushing it with your bare hands, inevitably some of the poudrin doesn't get converted into slime and is therefore wasted. Some clever miners found out that you could combine cyanide with a water mixture and when you submerged a poudrin into it, you'd be able to strain it all and wind up with a particularly well concentrated distillation of pure slime-- perfect for crushing. Well, this was so popular that the leftover sludge mixture began to pile up and up until its containment unit broke and flooded all the shafts in the region with its goopy innards. All of the bogs you see around you were once profitable mineshafts. This street connects back into Toxington. This street is connected to Curie Highschool, Gravel Mounds, and Quarantined Zones.",
