See, crushing poudrins ain't a science, it's an art. When just crushing it with your bare hands, inevitably some of the poudrin doesn't get converted into slime and is therefore wasted. Some clever miners found out that you could combine cyanide with a water mixture and when you submerged a poudrin into it, you'd be able to strain it all and wind up with a particularly well concentrated distillation of pure slime-- perfect for crushing. Well, this was so popular that the leftover sludge mixture began to pile up and up until its containment unit broke and flooded all the shafts in the region with its goopy innards. All of the bogs you see around you were once profitable mineshafts. This street connects back into Toxington. This street is connected to Curie Highschool, Gravel Mounds, and Quarantined Zones.",

In this dense concrete jungle, your attention is constantly being divided among a thousand different things. Neon, fluorescent signs flash advertisements for all manner of amenities and businesses. The streets rumble with the sound of engines and metal scraping from the subway system deep underground. Hordes of men and women from every imaginable background walk these cruel streets, trying desperately to eke out a pitiful existence for themselves. This district never unwinds from its constant 24/7 slime-induced mania for even a moment, let alone sleep.\nDowntown is the beating heart of New Los Angeles City, aka Neo Milwaukee. With settlements in the area predating the emergence of slime, its prime location along the newly formed coastline naturally grew it into the cultural, economic, and literal center of the city. Due to its symbolic and strategic importance, it's home to the most intense gang violence of the city. Gunshots and screams followed by police sirens are background noises for this district. Some say that this propensity for violence is result of the sinister influence from an old obelisk in the center of town, ominously called ENDLESS WAR. You aren\u2019t sure if you believe that, though.\n\nThis area contains ENDLESS WAR, SlimeCorp HQ, the Slime Stock Exchange and the Downtown Subway Station. To the north is Smogsburg. To the East is the Green Light District. To the South is the Rowdy Roughhouse. To the Southwest is Poudrin Alley. To the West is Krak Bay. To the Northwest is Cop Killtown. \n\nThe wrecked Slimecorp Building has broken pieces of its structure littered around the city, too. You can access every floor from here.\nAvailable floors: 1f, 3f, 8f, 20f, 103f, 5280f, 77777f, 809231f, and Penthouse.",

These neglected, overgrown open spaces only help to congest the poor communities of Jaywalker Plains into tightly packed slums. This, coupled with being a backwater on the edge of the city with nothing to do, has bred a district that leads the city only in amount of narcotics injected per capita. Everyone is on a bad trip in Jaywalker Plain. Maniacs roam the street, screaming obscenities and striping naked in public. Homeless men ramble incoherent nonsense while picking drunken fights with one another on the side of the street. Many strange and unusual crimes are perpetrated here and reported on by local news teams to the amusement of residents of neighboring districts. \u201cDid you hear what that guy from Jaywalker Plain did the other day?\u201d is a common conversation starter in the western districts.\nJaywalker Plain has actually become a common residential district for lower income students attending the nearby Neo Milwaukee State wanting to avoid the already cheap rates of apartments in North Sleezebrorough. Because of this, you\u2019re guaranteed to see a lot of young artists and hipsters roaming this broken, nightmare hellscape of a district looking for cafes to leech Wi-Fi access off of. Good luck with that.\n\nThis area contains the Jaywalker Plain Pier and the Jaywalker Plain Subway Station. To the North is West Glocksbury. To the Northeast is Glocksbury. To the East is North Sleezeborough. To the Southwest is Crookline. To the South is Dreadford. To the West is West Outskirts Edge.",

You\u2019ll have to keep your wits about you if you want to leave here with your wallet, as Crookline is perhaps most known for its hordes of petty thieves who specialise in stealing from clueless juveniles from the posher districts. Despite these hurdles, or possibly because of them, Crookline has a bustling nightlife heavily featuring those aforementioned speakeasies.

You sort of feel like you\u2019re on the set of a film noir movie when you traverse these dark alleyways.\nCrookline was a historically rebellious settlement on the edge of New Los Angeles City aka Neo Milwaukee, resisting full annexation for years until it was fully culturally and economically dominated by the city. Because of this, the residents have always kept an independent streak, and remain vehemently opposed most aspects of slime past its purely utilitarian purposes. You get the feeling the denizens of this district would have been happier if there was gold discovered in the area rather than the green, morality-obliterating substance they\u2019re stuck with.\n\nThis area contains the Crookline Pier and the NLACakaNM Clinic of Slimoplasty.

Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately for the thrill seekers *Among Us*, the mountains here are far too steep for anyone to actually ski down without a death wish to attempt them. Seriously, there are just a series of ninety degree drops in some places, and that\u2019s not even to mention the yetis, don\u2019t even get me started on the yetis. Of course, none of this stops the locals, who eagerly careen off the side of cliffs and then take the lift back up for seconds after they revive. If you want to down some cheap instant hot cocoa before flying off the summit of a fucking mountain, then this district is for you. Maimridge used to be considered part of the outskirts, but recently it has grown enough of a stable population to be considered a real district. Its claim to fame is, of course, the impressive mountains in its borders. To the south is Astatine Heights. Toxington is to the west, Arsonbrook to the east, and the Northwest Outskirts are to the north. ",

Of course, they provide a level of vigilante justice to the neighborhood too, punishing random acts of lawlessness in favor of their totally reasonable brand of lawlessness. These gangsters are a part of a long, complex history in South Sleezeborough between local weeaboos, immigrant westaboos, and their struggle for supremacy. This thorny issue has even threatened the integrity of the Triad itself, as some members wish to cling unto their traditional way of life and show solidarity with the asianophile weeaboos, while others have grown accustomed to their new cultures and support the westaboos.

There\u2019s like a billion families here all battling over where each other can sell their illegal slime-based liquor that are totally legal but everyone wants to believe they aren\u2019t for old times\u2019 sake, who they\u2019re allowed to offer their \u201cprotection\u201d to, and what politicians they have the privilege of whacking. Lots of pizza places \u2018round here. This street connects back into South Sleezeborough. This street is connected to Chinatown, Little Tokyo, and WWW Ring. This street also exits into The Dojo",

They're fucking ripped, wear suits and ties that are totally on fleek, are inked head-to-toe in intracate and geneally fucking crazy tattoos, and can kick your ass using psychic powers. I don't even really know what crimes they commit, all I see them do is get drunk in the ramen bars in their shopping center, beat the shit out of each other and passerbys, and go on romantic adventures to kill westerners and other degenerate races. What\u2019s not to like? This gang is not to be confused with the Yellow Yakuza, which has way more members. This street connects back into South Sleezeborough.

See, crushing poudrins ain\u2019t a science, it\u2019s an art. When just crushing it with your bare hands, inevitably some of the poudrin doesn\u2019t get converted into slime and is therefore wasted. Some clever miners found out that you could combine cyanide with a water mixture and when you submerged a poudrin into it, you\u2019d be able to strain it all and wind up with a particularly well concentrated distillation of pure slime-- perfect for crushing. Well, this was so popular that the leftover sludge mixture began to pile up and up until its containment unit broke and flooded all the shafts in the region with its goopy innards. All of the bogs you see around you were once profitable mineshafts. This street connects back into Toxington. This street is connected to Curie Highschool, Gravel Mounds, and Quarantined Zones.",

That isn\u2019t to say a little fear of death stopped anyone from mining slime, but the sheer concentration of radiation here made it hard to even get to the slime veins in the first place before croaking. Plus, with the gravel mounds just a hop, skip, and a jump away, who needs to waste time making razor thin profit margins here when they can throw their lives away in shafts where they\u2019ll actually make some real slime.

Here, games like that are just an excuse to pick a fight with people so you can bash their skull in with a casus belli. It\u2019s pretty cool. Also, all of the buskers are fucking metal, doing insane tricks that extert their body to their absolute limit for the promise of some slime tips. Often, buskers just fucking die because they\u2019ve encased themselves in metal or something for the crowd\u2019s sick enjoyment. This street connects back into New New Yonkers.

You are surrounded on all sides by Yum! Brands restaurants, as the area is one big combination Pizza Hut/Taco Bell/Kentucky Fried Chicken. In the court\u2019s center lies the esteemed Mountain Dew fountain, dispensing that glorious piss yellow elixir for all who patron it. Bustling with life, this is the happeningest place in New Los Angeles City aka Neo Milwaukee for a hip juvenile such as yourself. So hang out with your fellow gangsters, soak in the outdated mall music and savor the moment. When you\u2019re old and brittle, you\u2019ll wish you spent your time doing this more.\n\nExits into Krak Bay.",

The windows are completely packed by dusty non-perishables, and the interior is not much better with every inch of space selling snacks or household basics in a visually deafening assault of brand names. However, those in the know simply stroll past all this noise and head for the old Snapple machine in the back of the shop. The machine is not that at all but a door that slides open to reveal a whole other store on the other side, this is the real Bodega. Neatly appointed, lacquered shelves hold the latest in street and skate fashion from shoes to shirts to jackets. The whole space is clean and orderly in a far cry from the cramped store front.\n\n(This description was literally just stolen and lightly edited from Atlas Obsurca. This is a real place in Boston, look it up. Pretty sick, huh?)\n\nThe well-trimmed, over-cologned four-eyed hipster behind the counter looks upon you with what can only be described as the freakish offspring of utter disdain and mindlessly sycophantic puppy-dog eyes that hope to lure you into an ill-advised purchase of high end socks that forces you to take out a second mortgage on your house. *SHARP INHALE*. He\u2019ll !sew the dirty, unwashed rags you dare call clothing back together if it gets shredded in combat, for a price. You can also get your old outfits !retrofit'd with added combat functionalities here, also for a price.\n\nExits into Krak Bay.",
